Guess what the computer is thinking!

Each game you have 9 guesses to determine which letter the computer is thinking.

If you guess the correct letter within the 9 turns then you win and you will have one "win" tallied.

If you don't guess the correct letter within the 9 turns then you lose and you will have one "lose" tallied.
